  abstract  = {Diffusion MRI tractography processing pipeline requires a large number of steps (typically 20+ steps). If parameters of these steps, number of threads, and random seed generators are not carefully controlled, the resulting tractography can easily be non-reproducible and non-replicable, even in test-test experiments. To handle these issues, we developed TractoFlow. TractoFlow is fully automatic from raw diffusion weighted images to tractography. The pipeline also outputs classical diffusion tensor imaging measures and several fiber orientation distribution function measures. TractoFlow supports the recent Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) format as input and is based on two engines: Nextflow and Singularity. In this work, the TractoFlow pipeline is evaluated on three databases and shown to be efficient and reproducible from 98{\%} to 100{\%}, depending on parameter choices. Moreover, it is easy to use for non-technical users, with little to no installation requirements. TractoFlow is publicly available for academic research and is an important step forward for better structural brain connectivity mapping.},

We propose a model, which can account for the non-linear characteristics of movement effects, known to result from the acquisition methods used to form these images. The model also facilitates the proper application of temporal corrections, which are needed to compensate for acquisition delays. Results of an implementation based on this model reveal that it is possible to correct these effects, leading to accurate realignment and timing correction.},

  abstract  = {Increasing interest in the structural and functional organisation of the human brain encourages the acquisition of big data sets comprising multiple neuroimaging modalities, often accompanied by additional information obtained from health records, cognitive tests, biomarkers and genotypes. Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging data enables a range of promising imaging phenotypes probing structural connections as well as macroanatomical and microstructural properties of the brain. The reliability and biological sensitivity and specificity of diffusion data depend on processing pipeline. A state-of-the-art framework for data processing facilitates cross-study harmonisation and reduces pipeline-related variability. Using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 218 individuals in the UK Biobank, we evaluate the effects of different processing steps that have been suggested to reduce imaging artefacts and improve reliability of diffusion metrics. In lack of a ground truth, we compared diffusion metric sensitivity to age between pipelines. By comparing distributions and age sensitivity of the resulting diffusion metrics based on different approaches (diffusion tensor imaging, diffusion kurtosis imaging and white matter tract integrity), we evaluate a general pipeline comprising seven postprocessing blocks: noise correction; Gibbs ringing correction; evaluation of field distortions; susceptibility, eddy-current and motion-induced distortion corrections; bias field correction; spatial smoothing and final diffusion metric estimations. Based on this evaluation, we suggest an optimised processing pipeline for diffusion weighted MRI data.},

  abstract  = {Head motion is a major confounding factor in neuroimaging studies. While numerous studies have investigated how motion impacts estimates of functional connectivity, the effects of motion on structural connectivity measured using diffusion MRI have not received the same level of attention, despite the fact that, like functional MRI, diffusion MRI relies on elaborate preprocessing pipelines that require multiple choices at each step. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of how these choices influence motion-related contamination of structural connectivity estimates. Using a healthy adult sample (N = 294), we evaluated 240 different preprocessing pipelines, devised using plausible combinations of different choices related to explicit head motion correction, tractography propagation algorithms, track seeding methods, track termination constraints, quantitative metrics derived for each connectome edge, and parcellations. We found that an approach to motion correction that includes outlier replacement and within-slice volume correction led to a dramatic reduction in cross-subject correlations between head motion and structural connectivity strength, and that motion contamination is more severe when quantifying connectivity strength using mean tract fractional anisotropy rather than streamline count. We also show that the choice of preprocessing strategy can significantly influence subsequent inferences about network organization, with the location of network hubs varying considerably depending on the specific preprocessing steps applied. Our findings indicate that the impact of motion on structural connectivity can be successfully mitigated using recent motion-correction algorithms that include outlier replacement and within-slice motion correction.},

  abstract     = {Dealing with confounds is an essential step in large cohort studies to address problems such as unexplained variance and spurious correlations. UK Biobank is a powerful resource for studying associations between imaging and non-imaging measures such as lifestyle factors and health outcomes, in part because of the large subject numbers. However, the resulting high statistical power also raises the sensitivity to confound effects, which therefore have to be carefully considered. In this work we describe a set of possible confounds (including non-linear effects and interactions that researchers may wish to consider for their studies using such data). We include descriptions of how we can estimate the confounds, and study the extent to which each of these confounds affects the data, and the spurious correlations that may arise if they are not controlled. Finally, we discuss several issues that future studies should consider when dealing with confounds.},
