# neuroimage-review-2022

This repository aims to collect and classify a list of methods and toolboxes related to diffusion MRI preprocessing, which is available for the community to contribute to. This hopefully facilitates the navigation through the breadth of methods and software packages available, as well as keeping an up-to-date overview of dMRI preprocessing developments.

Please see the associated publication in [NeuroImage](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118830).

## Contribute
Files will appear online shortly.

The Preprocessing_database.xlsx file Methods tab lists diffusion MRI preprocessing methods, and the Toolboxes tab lists pipelines or toolboxes/software platforms. The bibtex entries refer to references in the references.bib. To contribute to this list, you can send your entry to the spreadsheet in a separate .xlsx file to dmripreprocessing@gmail.com.
